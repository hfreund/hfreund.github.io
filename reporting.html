            <p class="meta">Design lead: lo to high fidelity mockups and prototypes, conducted usability testing with
                internal and external candidates.</p>
            <p class="meta">Results: new market possibilities for self service security evaluation; reduced effort to
                manually generate reports while saving cost for existing customers; achieved efficiencies in design
                process and collaboration with the front and backend engineers.</p>

            <h3>Problem: Security teams lack a complete picture of their stack efficacy. Facing tightening budgets and
                great accountability, they need to maximize coverage by their stack of security tools and provide high
                level reporting in addition to detailed analysis.</h3>
            <p>This level of sophisticaed analysis was previously available only to select enterprise organizations
                willing to pay for professional level services to conduct lengthly manual assessments. Because of the
                cost and effort required, this type of assessment was rarely conducted, leaving teams vulnerable to
                overspending on tools they did not need or failing to procure or properly configure the tools they
                needed most.</p>
            <p>Hearing customer feedback in this area, we identified seven popular security tools to integrate into a
                fully self-service solution for running realistic threat scenarios against a high-fidelity cyber range.
                We used our existing manual reports that were popular with customers as a basis for prototypes used to
                gather additional input. I conducted internal reviews with cyber sercurity experts from across our
                organization and heard from external customers and potential users about what they needed most out of
                this exercise.</p>

            <p class="byline">During usability testing, a key theme that emerged was a desire to test API connections before running threat scenarios.</p>
            <p>Users did not want to discover a tool failed to capture the correct data after waiting several hours for attacks to complete. We created a two path solution: a manual test users could perform anytime and an automated pre-flight check that would ping each endpoint when a user initiated the first attack. If all endpoints responded with an OK status, the lab would continue.</p>
